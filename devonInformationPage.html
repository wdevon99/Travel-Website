			<h2>-	Accessibility </h2>

	
			<p>	•	The “alt” attribute is used in the < img > tag when images are used ,so that a person with sight can recognize what the picture is using a screen reader. </p> 
			<p> •	The respective labels for each radio button is linked to its labels so that the user can click the label which to activate the radio button, which will increase the 			accessibility </p>
			<p>	•	The colours selected are such that a person surffring from colour blindness would not find it difficult to view the web site</p>	
			<p>	•	Access key are used to improve acceablity in forms,so that people who are more used to using only the keyboard will find it easier to use the web site</p>





			<h2>-	Typography </h2>


			<p>•	The fonts sizes are used in a way that a clear hierarchy is shown in the web site. Larger font size for headings, medium for sub-headings and small for paragraphs 	and other text</p>
			<p>•	The font-family used for the main body of the web site is a sans serif font .The reasons for choosing that are:</p>
				<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;---> Sans-serif font has a large x-height, which makes the letter look more clear and easy to read</p>
				<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;---> Sans-serif font has a low stroke contrast, the thickness of the strokes being consistent also makes it easier for the user to read and understand the text in the web site.</p>
				

 


			<h2>-	Colour (contrast) </h2>

			<img src="css/img/contrastCheck2.png" width="465px" alt="contrastChecker2">

			<p>In the web site , mainly the text color is black and the background color is white. The contrast check 1 shows the results when the background is white and the text is black. There are also some places in the site where the background is black and the text is white. The contract check 2 shows the result for such area.</p> 




			<h2>-	Colour (balance / combination) </h2>
			<p>•	Black text and white background was used because, even in the gray scale it will appear the same, so a color blind person will not get affected when viewing the site.</p>

			<p>•	More images with green and blue color have been included when designing the web site as the site is about tourism in Srilanka. Srilanka is a country filled with greenery and surrounded by the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blue ocean, so use of these colors will significantly affect the main purpose of the website, that is to express the users the true beauty of Srilanka

			<h3>* Similarity</h3> 

			<p> The buttons in the navigation bar looks the same and the hover effect also looks the same for all buttons</p>

			<h3>* Proximity</h3> 

			<p>The proximity between the label and the respective text fields in the form , makes it easier for the user to identify which text field each label correspond to</p> 

			<h3>* Closure</h3> 

			<p>The ending of the form is clear defined by the end of the box containing the form elements</p> 


			<h3>* Continuance</h3> 

			<p>The form has a continuous down ward flow, finally leading to the submit button</p>
